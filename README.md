## What is the Sierpinski triangle?
To put it in the most simplest explanation, its an equilateral triangle that gets subdivided into smaller triangles.

## How it works
Its a loop of shrinking the triangle into half of its height and width (1/2), and 
we make 3 copies of that and they are placed at the corners of the original triangle (top, bottom-left & bottom-right). You repeat this for every triangle.

## How to run it - Cloning with GIT
